“Wir stehen morgens nie auf, ohne uns das Gesicht zu waschen, aber wir vernachlässigen oft die innere Reinigung durch das Wort des Herrn. Es weckt uns auf zum Innewerden unserer Verantwortung.”  
Im Schatten des Allmächtigen by Elisabeth Elliot, S. 32  

Read the Word Systematically  
"Also, it is of immense importance for the understanding Of the Word of God, to read it systematically, so that every day we may read a portion of the Old and a portion of the New Iestament, going on where we previously left off. The reasons to read the Bible in a systematic way are as follows: This method is important, first, because it throws light upon the connection between the Old and New Testaments; a different method, where one habitually selects favorite chapters, will make it utterly impossible ever to understand much of the Scriptures. Second, while we are in the body, we need a change, even in spiritual things; and this change the Lord has graciously provided in the great variety that is to be found in His Word."
*George Müller* (S.99 - Release the Power of Prayer)  

"If anyone should ask me how he may read the Scriptures most profitably, I would advise him that above all he should seek to have it settled in his own mind that God alone, by His Spirit, can teach him. Also, since he will be asking God for blessings, it is a beneficial idea to seek God's blessing before reading the Word, as well as during the reading of Scripture. Moreover, he should have it settled in his mind that, although the Holy Spirit is the best and sufficient teacher, this Teacher does not always teach immediately when we desire it, and that, therefore, we may have to ask Him again and again for the explanation of certain passages. But He will surely teach us at last, if indeed we are seeking for light prayerfully, patiently, and with a view to the glory of God."  
*George Müller* (S.99 - Release the Power of Prayer)
